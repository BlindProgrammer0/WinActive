##Welcome to WinActive!
###What is WinActive?
WinActive is a KMS (Key Management Service) software.
KMS is a technology used by Microsoft to activate software deployed in bulk (e.g., in a corporate environment). What WinActive and similar KMS programs does is to replace the installed key with a volume license key, create an emulated instance of a KMS server on your machine and force the products to activate against this KMS server.

###Future plans
The plan is to expand WinActive to be more than just a KMS tool, below is some ideas I have:
- Fully Async.
- Ability to display system info such as temperature, components etc.
- Ability to export all installed programs.
- Ability to uninstall programs.
- Abillity to save list of all installed softwares.
- Create a auto deploy and setup system.

This list will probably continue to grow with time, and if you have some ideas that might be good to have feel free to open a Pull Request!
